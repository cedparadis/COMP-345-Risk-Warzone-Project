	// 1) A player receives the correct number of armies in the reinforcmenet phase (showing multiple cases)
	// 2) A player will only issue deploy orders and no other kind of orders if they still have armies in their reinforcement pool
	// 3) A player can issue advance orders to either defend or attack, based on the toAttack and toDefend lists
	// 4) A plaer can play cards to issue orders
	// 5) A player that does not control any territory is removed from the game.
	// 6) The game ends when a single player controls all the territories
