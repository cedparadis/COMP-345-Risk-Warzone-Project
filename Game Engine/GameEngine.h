// Create a finite state machine for the game engine 
//Create an enum that represents the different possible states
//For each state create a function with the name of the state that is being call when the user wants to transition to that state
//always set the currentstate after executing the function

//*****OR*****
//State are classes inherited from general State class
//a variable contains the current state(like an enum)
//When player calls a command, it will point to the right state class and execute the run method of  the class which will do the work in the state.
//When the run method is done, to do a transition, player needs to enter command prompt that will change the variable of the currentstate and point to the next one


//create an enum variable to keep track of the current state in the switch statement





//create a function pointer to other functions which acts like states

//void (*state)();
